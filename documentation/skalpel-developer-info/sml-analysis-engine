================================================================================
                                   Compilation
================================================================================

It is assumed that the user is in the analysis-engines/standard-ml/
directory.

If you have access to the files of another group member, it is
advisable to copy their whole analysis-engines/ folder over your own,
which will have all of the generated files (such as Makefiles, .mlb
files, cmtotes binary etc) for you. Otherwise you should run the
./configure script to generate the Makefile, and then run make
mlton-bin-gen to compile the analysis engine.

You may notice on compilation that this error appears:

Error: /usr/lib/mlton/sml/smlnj-lib/JSON/json-lib.mlb 19.35 File
  /Users/mtf/devel/smlnj/smlnj-110.72/lib/ml-lpt-lib.cm/ml-lpt-lib.mlb
  does not exist.

This is a bug in a library. First, copy the ml-lpt folder provided in
the source repository of the SML/NJ compiler into
/usr/lib/mlton/sml/smlnj-lib/ folder, and then change line 19 of the
file with the error in it (json-lib.mlb) above to
$(SML_LIB)/smlnj-lib/ml-lpt/lib/ml-lpt-lib.mlb. Now try compiling
again.

If you cannot compile the analysis engine, and the documentation here
does not describe the problem you are having, _please_ write some
documentation explaining the problem and how it can be fixed (if you
figure that out!).

================================================================================
                            Abbreviations
================================================================================

As few abbreviations should be used as possible should be used in the
analysis engine. The more abbreviations that are used, the more
confusing the code becomes. That said, it is true that very long lines
of code are also not good programming practice. Therefore a list of
allowed abbreviations are below, and any new created should be added
to this list.

Note that such a list of abbreviations doesn't apply to simple small
uses of variables for example x in fn x => x, but rather to frequently
used letters, such as datatype constructors and function names. For
example, getND is a bad function name for a function that returns
typename dependancies. Use getTypenameDependancies instead, so anyone
who looks at the code has a fair idea of what is going on. Structure
names are exempt from all of this (eg structure T = Ty is acceptable).

cons - constructor
var(s)  - variable(s)
poly - polymorphic
mono - monomorphic
id   - identifier
struct - structure
env  - environment
lab  - label
info - information
gen  - generate
