###############################################################

1. Check and update all documentation.

2. Build all documentation. (.texi turned into .info, .tex turned into .pdf etc).

3. Check Skalpel can be compiled correctly on that machine.

4. Change the value of the SKALPEL_VERSION variable in RunSlicer.sml to the new version number and recompile.

5. Change the value of VERSION in create-src-package.sh to the new version number.

6. Check that inside the create-src-package.sh script all files to be copied exist, adding new paths for new files as appropriate.

7. Run create-src-package.sh on a red hat like machine. This will create:

   - the source archive (.tar.gz)
   - the debian source package (-src.tar.gz)
   - rpm package (.rpm)
   - source rpm package (.srpm)

8. Run create-src-package.sh on a debian machine. This will create:

   - the debian package (.deb)

9. (currently broken, skip this step) Run create-src-package.sh on a mac machine. This will create:

   - the mac package (.bom)
