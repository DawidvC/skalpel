================================================================================
                                   Structure
================================================================================

At this time of writing, 2012-07-23-01, the test framework works as
follows. In the testing/ folder at the root of the Skalpel repository
there is a shell script named 'run-test-framework.sh'. This file runs
tests on various aspects of the project, and currently takes no
parameters. Were one to execute this script, testing would begin and a
report would be generated in the form of an e-mail, which is then sent
to e-mail addresses which are currently programmed into this file.

There are three sub-folders in the testing/ folder of the Skalpel
repository. They are:

analysis-engine-tests/
scripts/
test-results/

The folder named 'analysis-engine-tests' contains the analysis engine
test database. This is nothing more than a collection of target
language code files (named code[number].sml), accompanied with what
are deemed to be the 'answers' to these tests (named
test[number]). The analysis engine takes each of these files in turn
as input, generates type error slices, then compares its results with
the associated answer file. The answer files are written in JSON
format.

The 'scripts' folder contains other shell scripts used for
testing. Currently, this folder only contains a script which checks
the Skalpel project website for dead links, but it's very possible
other scripts will go there in the future.

The 'test-results' folder contains the results of the test framework
for each day. Currently, this folder contains many subfolders, each
with a date. Inside each of those folders are files which report the
test results for that day.

================================================================================
                                Daily Execution
================================================================================

The test framework is executed daily on lxultra8. This has been done
by using a cronjob. The result of the list of crontabs using the
command 'crontab -l' on lxultra8 is currently this:

0 7 * * * /u1/pg/jp95/repos/skalpel/testing/run-test-framework.sh
>/u1/pg/jp95/test-framework-output 2>/u1/pg/jp95/test-framework-errors
