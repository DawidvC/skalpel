To compile the source code for Skalpel, first run the configuration
file:

./configure

The configuration file can be called with the prefix parameter to
install the program to a specific location. See ./configure --help for
details. Please note that if you do use the prefix option, then Emacs
will not automatically detect the configuration file which states the
locations of all of the .el files for use with Emacs. You can find
this file in <prefix>/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-start.d/skalpel-config.el.

You should then run the make command with:

$ make

This will build everything in the source folder, including the Skalpel
binary, the command-line interface.

Skalpel can be installed in a number of different ways:

$ make install

With this option everything is installed, including the binary,
command-line interface, and the Emacs user interface.

$ make install-slicer

Only the slicer is installed, without any user interfaces.

$ make install-cmd-line

Skalpel and the command-line interface are installed.

$ make install-emacsui

Skalpel is installed along with the Emacs user interface.

To install the Debian source package, just run the debian/rules script
for the extracted directory.
