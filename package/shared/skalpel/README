The type error slicer for SML is developed by the ULTRA group of
Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh.

Traditional type error messages given for SML can be hard to decipher
and often indicate incomplete and unprecise locations as the source of
the programming error.  The error messages produced are also biased
because they report only one location which is dependent on the way
which the abstract syntax tree is traversed.

The type error slicing tool - Skalpel - aims to eliminate these
problems.  The error messages produced by the type error slicer offer
textual explanations of the errors and highlights all and
only those program points which contribute to the error.

For more information on how to use the type error slicer please refer
to the man page of the "skalpel" command.
