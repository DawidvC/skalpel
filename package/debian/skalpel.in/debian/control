Description: A type error slicer for SML.
   The type error slicer for SML is developed by the ULTRA group of
   Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh.  Traditional type error messages
   given for SML can be hard to decipher and often indicate incomplete
   and unprecise locations as the source of the programming error.
   The error messages produced are also biased because they report
   only one location which is dependent on the way which the abstract
   syntax tree is traversed.  The type error slicing tool aims to
   eliminate these problems.  The error messages produced by the type
   error slicer offer textual error messages of the errors and
   highlights all and only those program points which contribute to
   the error.
